## About Project

Simple next js app with auth page, general page and authors page. You could log in as commentator or as author. As commentator you have ability to comment any post from list and view all posts from selected author. As author you have ability to add new posts to list. For state manager i used context api, for data i used custom list.

During work was little issues with auth form.

Technology stack: Next js, Context Api, MUI, Supabase
